The cities, the mountains, the streets, and even the silences I’ve passed through feel like mirrors—each revealing a little more of who I am and who I aspire to become - travel not to escape, but to remember - and the memories I carry, they stay with me, etched into eternity..

The opportunity is ubiquitous - we need to stay true, keep learning, write often, be less control by distraction, meditate, and more importantly JUST DO. The possibility is endless and sky is the limit. Working remotely with people across the world has given me that sense, no matter where we are and come from we together can achieve our goal.
