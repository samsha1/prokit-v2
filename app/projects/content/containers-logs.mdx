Containers Log Processing Pipeline is a real-time data log processing system designed for internal developers to run/debug their plugins seamlessly. It is responsible for collecting log data from various containers, processing it in real-time, and storing it in a scalable way to debug in a decisive way later. The system utilizes RabbitMQ for log collection, AWS kinesis for data ingestion, Apache Flink for stream processing, and ElasticSearch as a part of the EFK stack for data storage and visualization.

Technologies Used:

- Fluend: Log Collection
- AWS Kinesis: Data ingestion
- Apache Flink in JAVA: Data Stream Processing
- ElasticSearch as a part of EFK stack: Data Storage and Visualization.
- Other tools: Git, Drone for Continuous Integration, Kubernetes for container orchestration.

## Flink Architecture:

The figure above illustrates, Flink Bolt reads data from Kinesis in real-time, applies some truncation to the data to reduce its size, and then stores it in Elasticsearch, which is a highly scalable open-source search and analytics engine. The truncation is done to reduce the log size and optimize storage space in Elasticsearch.

Here's how the process works:

1. The Flink Bolt reads data from Kinesis in real-time.
2. The data is then processed, which involves applying the truncation to reduce its size.
3. Once the data is truncated and mapped with the keys, it is then sent to Elasticsearch for storage and indexing. Elasticsearch stores the data in a distributed manner and provides fast and efficient search capabilities.
4. Finally, the stored logs can be visualized using Kibana as shown below.

Overall, the Flink Bolt is a powerful tool for processing real-time data streams from Kinesis and storing it in Elasticsearch. This allows organizations to gain insights and make data-driven decisions in real-time, as well as improve their data storage and retrieval capabilities.
