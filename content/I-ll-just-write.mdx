20 Jul, 2025 - Thousands of words flows through mind, pods in ear - Just finished watching ZNMD (millions of time). This movie always hit different. I'll just write.

Recently, I withdrew my US visa and decided to stay back. It took me almost 2 years to summon this decision - still not sure wheather this was the right decision probably, time will tell. I don't have feel guilty in fact, it feels light. There was always this thing eating my brain and me inside.

It was a tough descision. There is a line from Naval "If you can't decide, the answer is NO", this totally implies here. I still remember my Visa interview day, with no preparation - always questioning - "Shall I withdraw?" / "I hope VO rejects my interview" & "I'll just go and tell all truth and VO rejects me". However, This didn't worked out as expected as "VISA Granted".
