On July 19, 2025, the Government of Nepal made a surprising [move](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/07/18/nepal-bans-telegram-over-online-fraud-concerns#:~:text=Nepal%20has%20banned%20the%20messaging,telecom%20regulator%20said%20on%20Friday.): Telegram was officially banned across the country.

For most, this might have been a minor inconvenience. But for me, it pulled the rug out from under my product — which was built entirely around Telegram’s gateway.

### Telegram had been best go-to for my [in-progress product](https://www.samrat.fyi/projects/ai-chat-code-agent) for a reason:

- Fast to build on
- Zero friction for testing
- No need for business verification or complex approval steps

It was lean, developer-friendly, and perfect for MVPs and POCs. This abrupt ban has put a full stop to that. I'm hopeful the government reconsiders this decision in the near future.

## The Pivot: WhatsApp Integration Begins
With Telegram out of reach, the 2nd planned integration was WhatsApp, but let’s be real — it’s not as straightforward as Telegram.
    <b>First Attempt: Meta’s Official WhatsApp Business API</b>
        Naturally, I started by exploring Meta’s native WhatsApp Business API. That journey quickly became a tangle of:
            - Government-level business verification
            - Waiting for approval
            - Hard-to-navigate documentation

While it’s clearly built for enterprise-scale products, it’s definitely not beginner- or POC-friendly.

### Enter Twilio: A Lifeline for Developers
After a day of struggling and wasting, I pivoted to Twilio’s WhatsApp integration — and it was a breath of fresh air. 

- Their sandbox environment made testing quick and easy
- No business documentation required
- Just connect, test, and iterate

For my current POC stage, Twilio is more than sufficient.

During my research, I also came across 360dialog, an official WhatsApp Business Solution Provider (BSP). They simplify WhatsApp API access significantly and skip many of Meta’s painful onboarding steps. But — there’s always a “but” — their pricing model didn’t align with where my product is today. Maybe in the future.


### Moving Forward
While losing Telegram was frustrating, this shift forced me to explore more robust messaging infrastructure and dive deeper into enterprise-level integrations. The learning curve has been steep, but worth it.

## Lesson learned: Always build with flexibility in mind — platform dependencies can break overnight.

I’ll be sharing more about my WhatsApp bot implementation, including real-time notifications, tech stacks, user interaction flows with AI chat Agent that builds a webpages on fly (lovable but inside yours-friendly Chat App).
